# Project Changes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to implement Google Sign-in via Supabase and profile picture upload functionality.

## `components/auth/auth-form.tsx`
- Added a visual separator with the text "Or continue with...".
- Integrated a "Google" button that triggers Supabase's Google OAuth sign-in flow (`supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth`).
- Added `handleGoogleSignIn` function to manage the Google sign-in process.

## `app/account/page.tsx`
- Imported `useFileUpload` hook and `updateAvatarUrl` action.
- Integrated a hidden file input element, linked to a `useRef`.
- Modified the camera icon button to trigger the hidden file input when clicked.
- Implemented `handleFileChange` function to handle file selection, upload the selected image using `useFileUpload`, and update the user's avatar URL via `updateAvatarUrl` upon successful upload.
- Added loading state (`isUploading`) to the camera icon button.

## `app/account/actions/account-actions.ts`
- Added a new asynchronous function `updateAvatarUrl(userId: string, avatarUrl: string)`.
- This function sends a PUT request to `/api/account/avatar` to update the user's avatar URL in Supabase.
- Includes error handling and toast notifications for success or failure.

## `app/api/account/avatar/route.ts`
- **Corrected implementation:** Now correctly updates the `profiles` table in Supabase with the new `avatar_url` for the given `user_id`.
- Utilizes `getSupabaseRouteHandler` to interact with Supabase.
- Includes validation for `userId` and `avatarUrl`, and comprehensive error handling.
